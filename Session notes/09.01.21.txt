Getting Jeffrey back{
    Teleport to Bryn Shander

    To the old temple{
        East of East Haven
        Everhart cast Gate, summoning Ames

        Ames do not have Jeffreys soul anymore, he has been sold and tortured for a long time
        He suggests to give Jeffrey back (in whatever shape he's in)
        Then he'll erase his True Name from our memories

        After negotiation he will allow one person to remember his Name
        Cue hour-long discussion about who owns Jeffreys soul

        Final contract{
            "You bring us Jeffreys soul physically, immediately ensure Jeffrey ownership of his soul, and never directly or indirectly work against us (including Jeffrey) or anyone we know, knew, or will know in the future. 
             The True Name, and only the True Name, will be erased from all but one, and that on person will not willfully exploit your true name again. The person who keeps the name also promise not to willfully share your true name with others. Disputed cases should be ruled favourably to us."

             You might go around it by letting someone know that a geas or similar might force you to reveal the Name
