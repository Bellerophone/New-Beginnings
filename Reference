Mythallar{
Its function was a simple one—it converted raw magic from the Weave and sent that power throughout an enclave to provide the magical energies required for the continued operation of quasimagical items. Every enclave contained at least one mythallar—especially since the mythallar was absolutely necessary to keep the city afloat.
The mythallar had an effective range of one mile. Therefore, if an enclave was larger than two miles in diameter, it had to have more than one mythallar.
When a quasimagical device was within the effect of the mythallar, it gained the ability to use the magical powers that had been imbued into it. Outside the area‚ quasimagical devices ceased to function as magical devices.
Sakkor's mythallar was unique in that its sentience allowed it to direct, focus or withhold its magical powers as instructed.
